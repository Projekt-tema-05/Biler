    <h1>Citroen</h1>
    <p>
      Citroën is a French automobile manufacturer known for its bold engineering
      and distinctive design philosophy. Founded in 1919 by industrialist André
      Citroën, the company quickly became a pioneer in automotive innovation,
      introducing breakthroughs such as Europe’s first mass-produced
      front-wheel-drive car, the Traction Avant, and the hydropneumatic
      suspension system featured in the iconic DS. Over the decades, Citroën has
      built a reputation for comfort, creativity, and unconventional styling,
      often pushing boundaries within the industry. Today, as part of the
      Stellantis group, the brand continues to focus on accessible mobility,
      electric vehicle development, and maintaining its long tradition of quirky
      yet practical automotive design.
